Climate change is a global issue that encapsulates everywhere from extreme weather catastrophes to rising sea levels, but digging deeper into the social impacts of climate change, there lies climate justice. 
  
## What is Climate Justice


Climate justice exceeds environmental and sustainability efforts. Climate justice is a term that stresses how climate change has differing social, economic, public health, and other adverse impacts on underprivileged populations. 

Climate justice is a civil rights movement. As stated by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, “Climate change is happening now and to all of us. No country or community is immune. And, as is always the case, the poor and vulnerable are the first to suffer and the worst hit.”  



## Geographic Disparities

Climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are felt most strongly by minority groups such as low-income communities, people of color, people with disabilities, and indigenous groups. 



Let’s examine Hurricane Katrina as a case study for climate justice. More than 16 years later, residents still feel Katrina’s ripples. Hurricane Katrina swept New Orleans on August 25th, 2005. It's estimated that more than 1800 people died and that the damage exceeded $100 billion. Throughout this decade-long recovery, Mark VanLandingham, a sociologist at Tulane University, headed a project on the health and well-being of Vietnamese immigrants who settled in an eastern part of New Orleans. Similarly, David Abramson, a public health researcher who studies disasters at New York University, surveyed predominantly black families on cheaper property that faced disproportionate damage following the storm. The studies and surveys continued to track the long-term effects of disaster and displacement on these minority communities. These researchers concluded that long-term mental health struggles were prevalent due to Katrina, despite the fact that only a small percentage of participants returned to their pre-hurricane homes. 



Hurricane Katrina is not a one-off occurrence. In recent years, Hurricane Harvey was a category four disaster that was devastating to Texas communities, especially minority communities.

### Takeaways 
37.27% of households affected by Hurricane Harvey fall under 20k-40k annual salary, while 24.36% of households affected fall under 40k-60k annual salary. That means over half of the households affected by the disaster belonged to the lowest two income groups. Whereas, the percent of affected income groups 60k-80k, 80k-100k, and >120k summed to only 27%. Similarly, 40.23% of the affected population identified as Hispanic, and 28.47% of the affected population identified as Black. Data shows that the populations hit the hardest aligned closely with low-income, people of color groups. 

### Berlin City Case - Environmental Justice

Environmental justice in the city of Berlin focuses on how the subject can be measured. The first set of data focuses on the “objective parameters for the 447 planning areas of Berlin” (Bre, 2020), air pollution, and social status. The air pollution was measured using the annual average of NO2 and PM2.5 (fine particle matter, air pollutant), and the social status was studied using the set of six status and dynamic indicators taken from the field of social reporting in the overall Social Urban Development Monitoring 2013. This data was taken from the CDP survey, and KPIs on a city scale were identified. Therefore, these Berlin city datasets show how social and environmental issues are linked and can be applied to future work in studying environmental justice trends on different scales.

## Potential Improvements 
  
SEPHER (Socio-Economic Physical Housing Eviction Risk) focuses on identifying the populations (assessing impacts of climate-related hazards on the most vulnerable communities) to study in order to effectively provide sufficient aid. The SEPHER datasets combine data from the Social Vulnerability Index, FEMA’s National Risk for Natural Hazards, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, and trends of rental prices for properties. This data is used rather than commercial data because it is publicly available and does not cost the expensive price of purchasing commercial data. (Fecht, 2021). SURF (Stanford Urban Risk Framework) is a dataset that focuses on the populations most vulnerable to having their livelihoods destroyed by flooding, by utilizing “a human-centered approach to risk assessment” (Torrent, 2021). Researchers identified communities close to a fiscal tipping point and assessed their financial instability.  
  
## Closing Thoughts
  
 
Overall, climate justice is a movement that aims to help everyone as climate issues expose our collective society’s vulnerabilities, even if certain populations are hit harder. As a society, we need to stay proactive and remain vigilant on climate change, especially on how it impacts minority groups such as low-income communities, people of color, people with disabilities, and indigenous groups. Hurricane Harvey, a disaster just four years ago, was low-income and BIPOC (Black and Indigenous People of Color), with over 50% of the population affected. Beyond the U.S., in Berlin, there is a significant correlation between each of the city’s planning area’s social class and air pollution. Incorporating demographic, real estate, financial data and more enables us to be socially aware of these non-coincidental trends. Data reveals specific areas of groups that are or could be disproportionately impacted by global environmental factors. However, data alone cannot solve this problem. Data is an important step but research studies and community engagement are crucial to taking a stance on climate justice. Data provides insights, but it cannot act on these insights - that starts with Us.
