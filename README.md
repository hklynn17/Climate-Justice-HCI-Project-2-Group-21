#### What is Climate Justice


Climate justice exceeds environmental and sustainability efforts. Climate justice is a term that stresses how climate change has differing social, economic, public health, and other adverse impacts on underprivileged populations. 

Climate justice is a civil rights movement. As stated by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, “Climate change is happening now and to all of us. No country or community is immune. And, as is always the case, the poor and vulnerable are the first to suffer and the worst hit.”  



#### Geographic Disparities

Climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are felt most strongly by minority groups such as low-income communities, people of color, people with disabilities, and indigenous groups. 



Let’s examine Hurricane Katrina as a case study for climate justice. More than 16 years later, residents still feel Katrina’s ripples. Hurricane Katrina swept New Orleans on August 25th, 2005. It's estimated that more than 1800 people died and that the damage exceeded $100 billion. Throughout this decade-long recovery, Mark VanLandingham, a sociologist at Tulane University, headed a project on the health and well-being of Vietnamese immigrants who settled in an eastern part of New Orleans. Similarly, David Abramson, a public health researcher who studies disasters at New York University, surveyed predominantly black families on cheaper property that faced disproportionate damage following the storm. The studies and surveys continued to track the long-term effects of disaster and displacement on these minority communities. These researchers concluded that long-term mental health struggles were prevalent due to Katrina, despite the fact that only a small percentage of participants returned to their pre-hurricane homes. 



Hurricane Katrina is not a one-off occurrence. In recent years, Hurricane Harvey was a category four disaster that was devastating to Texas communities, especially minority communities.

Takeaways 
37.27% of households affected by Hurricane Harvey fall under 20k-40k annual salary, while 24.36% of households affected fall under 40k-60k annual salary. That means over half of the households affected by the disaster belonged to the lowest two income groups. Whereas, the percent of affected income groups 60k-80k, 80k-100k, and >120k summed to only 27%. Similarly, 40.23% of the affected population identified as Hispanic, and 28.47% of the affected population identified as Black. Data shows that the populations hit the hardest aligned closely with low-income, people of color groups. 

  
 
  
### Closing Thoughts
  
 
Overall, climate justice is a movement that aims to help everyone as climate issues expose our collective society’s vulnerabilities, even if certain populations are hit harder. And as a society, we need to stay proactive and remain vigilant on climate change, especially its impacts on minority groups such as low-income communities, people of color, people with disabilities, and indigenous groups. Hurricane Harvey, a disaster just four years ago, was low-income and BIPOC, with over 50% of the population affected.
